# Practical Recursion Tutorial by Examples 

# Introduction 

Recursion is one of the difficult topics for beginners in programming yet it is a very powerful tools that solves many challenging problems in a simple way.

I will try to provides simple examples that can be traced easily. I will also refer to nice animations available in youtube as well. 

The goal is to add many examples to cover different situations. The python code will be simple and well commented so one can transfer it to other languages easily. 

If you have any comments, questions,or feedback, pleas feel free to add to the discussion page. 


**How to use:**

- Create a google account if you don't have 
  - You can also download the python code or the notebook and run it locally if you have python or jupeter notebook installed. For this, select Data menu then Downloads.
- Open the notebook in google colab
- Select  Data menu then save a copy in drive. Then siwtch to the new saved notebook.
- Select Run-time menu then Run all
- Modify the code to learn more about it and do the tracing (this is important to understand how it works)
- Add your feedback to the [discussion]() section in github.
- If you have time, contribute by adding more examples or notebooks
- I appreciate [forking]() and [starring]() :)
